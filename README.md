# Zyiron Chain - Post-Quantum Payment System
### Version: 1.0 (Development)

## 🔹 Vision & Mission
Zyiron Chain is designed to be the most secure, efficient, and community-driven payment system. By leveraging post-quantum cryptography (PQC), efficient blockchain storage, and decentralized governance, it ensures robust security, seamless payments, and network scalability.

---

## 🔹 Blockchain Overview
Zyiron Chain utilizes **SHA3-384** hashing and **Falcon 512** for digital signatures, making it quantum-resistant. It is structured into two layers:

1️⃣ **Layer 1: Core Protocol** – Handles block creation, PoW consensus, and transaction validation.
2️⃣ **Layer 2: Instant Payments** – Supports multi-hop routing and batching for low-latency payments.


> **Current Status:** Layer 1 is fully implemented, and being debugged while Layer 2 is till under active development.

---

## 🔹 Key Features
✅ **Quantum-Resistant Security**: SHA3-384 hashing & Falcon 512 signatures.
✅ **Three-Layer Architecture**: Separation of core, payments, and governance.
✅ **Instant Payments**: Multi-hop routing for fast transactions.
✅ **Smart Transactions**: Programmable logic for automated transactions.Also know as SmartPay (under active development)
✅ **The Zyiron Foundation**: Advancing humanity and technology one block at a time 
✅ **Dynamic Block Sizes**: 1MB-10MB per block, depending on network traffic 300 second blocks
✅ **Two Mempools**:
   - **Standard Mempool** → Regular & Instant Transactions.
   - **Smart Mempool** → Smart Contract Transactions.
✅ **Proof-of-Work Consensus**: SHA3-384 PoW with dynamic difficulty adjustments.
✅ **Max Supply**: 70,000,000ƶ  ZYC no havling fixed block reward a 5ƶ ZYC utill max supply is mined 140 years 
   - **Smart Fund** 
✅ **Optimized Storage System**:
   - **LMDB**: Stores UTXOs, mempool, transactions, orphan blocks, fees, and analytics.
   - **TinyDB**: Manages node configurations & session data.
   - **block.data**: Full blockchain stored in indexed 512mb binary files.
